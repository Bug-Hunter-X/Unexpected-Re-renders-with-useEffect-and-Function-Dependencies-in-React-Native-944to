This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  The function may be recreated on every render, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially infinite loops.  This is because React compares the function references, not the function's contents, causing a perceived change even if the function's logic remains the same. For example:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const myFunction = () => {
      console.log('My function is called!');
    };
    myFunction();
    // This will run on every render because myFunction is a new reference each time.
    return () => {};
  }, [myFunction]); // myFunction is a new reference on every render

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
